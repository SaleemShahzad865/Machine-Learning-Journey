Linear Regression from Scratch vs Scikit-Learn
Overview
This notebook implements linear regression in two ways:

From scratch using Python and NumPy

Using scikit-learn's LinearRegression

The goal is to demonstrate understanding of the fundamental machine learning algorithm by building it manually and comparing results with a standard library implementation.

Requirements
Python 3.x

NumPy

scikit-learn

Matplotlib (for visualization)
